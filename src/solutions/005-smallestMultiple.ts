  PROBLEM 005
  What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

  Compute the smallest multiple of all numbers from 1 to a given number (num).
  - Upper bound for the multiple is the factorial of "num."
  - While looping through we can increment counter "i" by the given number since the solution must be a
    multiple of this number.
  - Counter "j" checks whether "i" is a factor of the numbers below "num" and if it is able to count up
    to the number without breaking we can return "i".
